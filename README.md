# üçø POPCORN
  The Powershell Movie Companion Script.  Popcorn can be used to add trailers to your movie collection, fix naming errors and it can also be triggered by Radarr to keep your trailers up to date with your recent additions.

  Long story short; This came about because I wanted trailers I could play on Jellyfin and I found trailers.ps1 by James Ashwin. So I forked it and "hot rodded" it.

### Requirements
- Powershell
- A movie library with the naming convention {Movie Title} ({Release Year}), example: Ghostbusters - (1984).

### Installation
- Download the script and extract in a directory of your choice.  If you want to connect it to Radarr make sure it is in a directory that is visible to your Radarr installation.

- Open Powershell and navigate to directory you save Popcorn in.

- Run ``./popcorn.ps1 install``

- Once that is done, you will need to edit the settings in the file for it to work.

- Run ``./popcorn.ps1 edit``

- You will need to change the following settings in order to make Popcorn work.

### Use Stand Alone
This is good to do for the first use.
- Open a PowerShell window.
- Navigate to the installation folder.
- Launch .\trailers.ps1 PATH_TO_MY_LIBRARY_ROOT_FOLDER (ex: .\trailers.ps1 z:\movies).
- Wait for the script to finish.

The first run will take a little bit of time depending on the size of your collection.
You can monitor download progress in the Powershell window or in the most recent log file stored under \logs.

### Connect with Radarr
This is the recommended usage.
- Open Radarr
- Create a new Connection
  - Go to 'Settings', 'Connect', '+' and select 'Custom Script'.
- Set the Notification Triggers to 'On Import' and 'On Rename'.
- Set the path to your copy of trailers.ps1.
- Test the Connection.
- Save the Connection.

### Turn off Logs
On Line 1 change "$LogActivity = $true"
to "$LogActivity = $false".
